===============================================================================
To build the assets, run following commands: 
    1) ./setup.basic.sh     # Initialize the environment for next steps.

    2) ./install.xen.sh     # Install Xen into this machine and make current OS as Dom0. 
                            # Reboot is required! This step may exit with no-zero (this case,
                            # you may need to install some dependencies that are required by Xen.)

    
    3) ./install.clickos.sh # After rebooting, run this script to install clickos. 

    4) ./install.ovs.sh     # Install Open Vswitch. ClickOS needs this. 

    After the four steps, the whole testbed is set up. 
    Then you may need to add some bridges or ports to ovs to support clickos.
